💧 Smart Water Metering System
🚀 Overview

The Smart Water Metering System (SWMS) is an intelligent IoT solution designed to monitor and manage water usage in real time. Built using Flutter, ESP32, and AI, the system enables users to track consumption, detect leaks, optimize water usage, and reduce wastage through data-driven insights.

🧠 Key Features

Real-time Monitoring: View live water usage data via sensors connected to ESP32 microcontrollers.

Leak Detection: AI models analyze consumption patterns to detect leaks or unusual spikes.

Smart Alerts: Get instant notifications via the mobile/web dashboard when abnormal usage is detected.

Data Visualization: Interactive graphs and dashboards show historical and current usage.

Remote Control: Control connected valves or pumps via the app.

User & Admin Dashboards: Manage accounts, monitor multiple meters, and generate reports.

🧩 System Architecture

Hardware Layer:

ESP32 microcontroller connected to flow, pressure, and ultrasonic sensors.

Wi-Fi module transmits data to the cloud.

Software Layer:

Backend: Firebase / Node.js server for data handling.

Frontend: Flutter mobile/web app for real-time visualization.

AI Engine: Python/Edge AI model predicts leaks and usage anomalies.
